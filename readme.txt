Help drive loyalty and repeat purchases whilst rewarding qualified paying customers by generating a personal dynamic coupon on the WooCommerce thankyou page.

== Description ==

Discount coupons for WooCommerce are most commonly used to attract customers prior to them making a purchase. This plugin uses a slightly different strategy that allows you to reward paying customers with a dynamic coupon after the customer makes a purchase.

The checkout thankyou page is often neglected as a place for encouraging re-engagement to drive conversions, however it is a perfect place to offer a dynamic coupon as the customer is only two clicks away from completing another purchase!

Even if the customer doesn't use the coupon themselves they will often give it to a friend, gaining you a new customer.

Thankyou coupons allows you to :

- Generate a dynamic personal coupon based on the customers billing first name
- Choose between a percentage or fixed cart amount discount
- Allow free shipping
- Usage per user and per coupons
- Disallow the coupon to be used in conjunction with other offers
- Set a coupon expiry date
- Specify a minimum order value
- Set your own personalised message to appear on the thankyou page
- Choose the color of the coupon to match your theme
